## Acceptance Criteria
```md
WHEN I visit the site
THEN I am presented with the login page where I am able to login in or create an account

WHEN I create an account
THEN the system prompts me for a username, email, password.

WHEN I visit the “My Team Members” page
THEN I see a list of the people I have previously entered on my team, a link to view/edit/print each person’s information, a link to export/print the entire team’s information, a link to remove a person from the team, and a link to add a person to the team.

WHEN I visit the Add/Edit Team Member page

This data would include:
-	Name

## Future Enhancements

- Potential to build in organization structure (and create a structural hierarchy Admins-->Managers-->teamleads)
- PKI-Public Key Infrastructure
- Having the ability to transfer team members to another manager
- Create a modal for sign in/sign up
- more user-friendly error messages
